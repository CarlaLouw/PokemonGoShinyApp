# PokemonGoShinyApp
This project was done for the STAT-240 course at SFU in 2018.
The purpose of this project was to explore various big data techniques and create
a shiny app to communicate the results of the statistical analysis to an audience.

The completed application, created with this code, can be found at:
https://shiny.rcg.sfu.ca/u/clouw/CarlaAppFinal/

Note that the server.r and ui.r files must be used together in order to work properly.
To start the application using RStudio, run the ui.r file. 
(To run, the ui.r and server.r must be in the same file location)

Note: I do not own the data used in this project, therefore the datafiles have not been included.
